**Super Mario Game Replica**

- This was built on IntelliJ, so you may want to make sure to mark the res directory as source root (right click -> 
mark directory as)
- This is just a starter replica of the game! I included the sprite sheets and added the mechanics of the game as I
recall them. You can attempt to continue from where I left it and finish building the game if you want!. Some things you
may want to implement:
  - A point system (collecting coins, lives, killing enemies, etc)
  - Sound effects
  - The rest of the levels (like res/level1.png)
  - A menu to move between levels
  - Boss fights
  - Possibly some refactoring (I tried to be as generic as possible with most of the classes, but I got lazy towards 
  the end haha)!

This is the last update I will be posting for a while. This started as a personal project, and I wanted to prove to 
myself that I could build a game of this complexity, all the while keeping my code as scalable and reusable as I could.
I believe I have achieved most of the objectives for this project, so anything beyond that would be just for the sake of
completing the game. 

Hopefully, I will feel the inspiration again and pick up from where I left.
